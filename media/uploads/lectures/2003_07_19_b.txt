Austerity, Guru and the Will of God

Question: I want to know what the point of austerity is. Because many times I think it's easy to lose the point of what it is. As brahmacaries we are trained to take more challenges, follow the principles, do austerities. Another side to that question is, a lot of times devotees speak of sickness or illness or, like if you go to India and you get dysentery, that's getting purified and thought of as an austerity in a sense. If you're sick and it's a purification, how is it a purification?

Swami: In the beginning of the creation it's said that the caturmukha Brahma, fourheaded Brahma, searched out his origin. Brahma, the idea is, is the collective of jiva souls, individual souls, the collective. Some times you may have heard that the jiva, the conditioned soul, is born first as Brahma. It means that all these jiva souls, all of us... There are different types of us. They are all pretty much the same, but there are other types as well. The jiva souls that have their origin in Maha-Visnu... Maha-Visnu is the expression of divinity that is involved in what we call the play of creation, the world. It's calle sristi lila. He, the one, desired to become many, and many souls manifest. Because he has some relationship with Maya, the material nature, as the presider over that, when he became many, the many became involved with Maya, with material nature. This is the idea. How that takes place, all these jivas are like in a sleeping condition within Visnu, in almost a homogenous type of condition, state. From homogeneity they move towards heterogeneity and they're distinguished from one another, materially speaking, by what we call karma, which has no beginning. It's a huge topic obviously, but briefly karma is in one sense the principle of justice. But I have seen that devotees often think of the principle of karma in terms of its being justice in a kind of a christian way, which is not the way in which we, the gaudiya vedantists, speak about karma. Karma means that material nature is habituated in a particular way. When we interact with material nature, there is a response. In a sense you see that God is not involved. It's not like you have done something bad, so God is punishing you. That's not how we look at karma. But you interact through thinking, willing, through actual physical action. You put something out to the environment in relation to material nature and something comes back. It's very precise, very exacting. This has been going on since forever, in cycles, right? The universe expands and it contracts. When it contracts all these souls are wound up into Visnu and when it expands again by his will they become many again, move from homogeneity to heterogeneity. In the course of that movement, the first principle movement from homogeneity to heterogeneity is the appearance of Brahma. He is like the collective, samasti jiva, the collective of all the jivas. Then as he manifests the world through the power he derives from Visnu, then souls are placed in different positions and differentiated from one another by the principle of karma that is suspended during the contraction of the universe. This is the story, if you will, of creation. There is a lot of philosophy to all this, but this is the story. Brahma is depicted as four-headed and he is firstborn. What does he do as he searches out his origin? He has got four heads so he looks in all directions, it means. Very seriously seeks out, what is my source? His approach in that regard is fully sincere. He's driven by this and really it's the predominating influence in his life. He gets an answer. He hears the sound "ta-pa", two letters of the sanskrit alphabet, ta-pa. It means austerity, tapa. He could understand from that that I shall perform austerity and this will be the means of knowing, the means by which I will come to know the answer to my question, my pursuit, what is my source, what is my origin, which includes what am I about, what is my purpose, what's the meaning of life and all these things. In a general sense this was the answer. Therefore austerity is very important. Austerity, tapa, means also knowledge. How do the to go together, austerity and knowledge? Well, if you want to know something, then you have to think deeply about it, right? You have to sit and you maybe have to find some situation where there is not a lot of distractions, sensual distractions, a quiet place. Find a place, sit down and let me think about it. If you want to study you go to the library, it's quiet there, it's conducive for that. The idea here is that by... Sense objects that attract our senses, things to see for our eyes, things to hear for our ears, things to smell for our nose, things to touch for our tactile sense and so forth, when we are interacting with these things, when our senses are interacting with sense objects then to that extent we're not thinking, we're not very deeply thinking. That's not a very well thought out thing to do. Why is that? Because what we want is to be happy. duhka yonaya evate (BG 5.22) Krsna says in the Gita, wisely, that the contact between the senses and sense objects, he says this gives birth to misery. Very simply put, why?, because the sense objects are here today and gone tomorrow. If you're attached to them and they are the source of your happiness, they will inevitably be the source of your distress, because they won't be there one day. So even if you like it, you say, well it's not, of course, a source of misery for me Maharaj, Swami, I like that. That's Ok, but then I have to inform you that you can't keep it. As much as you like it, as much it becomes a source of misery in due course. Such is the nature of the material experience, it's constantly in flux and in transformation. We say in common english parlance, here today and gone tomorrow. Contact with material objects, we are generalizing here of course, everyone has to determine wisely to what extent they need to be in touch with sense objects in order to have the balance in their life to pursue the kind of things that we are talking about. When I say that sense objects is a source of misery then you cannot run out of here today and say, I will never contact a sense object again. Maharaj said it was a source of misery, I understood his point, but we cannot live like that, so we have to have some interaction with sense objects. Even the monk has a license to beg for food, cloth, some minimal shelter and so forth. Isavasyam idam sarvam yat kim ca jagatyam jagat, tena tyaktena bhunjithah ma gridhah kasyasvid dhanam (Iso 1). The Isopanisad says, there is a quota for everybody. With good guidance we can learn to live within the quota and it also means that we should have some balance in our life. But in general, in principle, sense objects are a source of misery, so our life should not be solely preoccupied with that, or otherwise it will be a miserable existence. To the extent to which we are in touch with sense objects in pursuit of joy, again, we are not thinking very deeply. When we want to think deeply we tend to move away from the physical preoccupations that tend to distract us from thinking deeply. If they don't, they would n longer be objects of attraction for us. They are deceiving us in a sense, do you see? Sense objects deceive us into thinking poorly, not wisely. When you want to think deeply then you find a quiet place and you sit down without distractions. It means you move away from the physical realm to enter into the mental and intellectual realm. In our philosophy these are two realms of matter, of a crude form and a more subtle form, mental and intellectual being the subtle form, the world of the senses, the physical realm being the gross form. Just like, here of course is a generalization also, you tend to find that intellectuals are maybe oftentimes less inclined towards sports bars and the physical experience and joys of soccer and football and things like that. Thinking deeply and sense enjoyment don't go that well together. Austerity, of course there are different types of austerity, but the most basic type of austerity, is a physical austerity. When we voluntarily accept physical austerities, we have to accept physical austerities anyway, that's unavoidable, but when we do it voluntarily then some knowing, some greater knowing will be the fruit of that. Brahma understood this principle. It's the same thing we've talked about many times, I like to talk about, the same principle that by giving you will get. Austerity, penance, sacrifice, you see these are all connected, all related. Brahma learned at the beginning that things aren't what they seem. Getting, receiving, knowing, understanding, comes about in a mystical way by austerity, by penance, by sacrifice. He underwent sacrifice. Sacrifice is a kind of preliminary or crude form of love. It's the underpinning of love. Love is bout giving. At some point giving will be a sacrifice, giving will be penance, it will be an austerity, right? But as we do that and we do it voluntarily with understanding and so forth, it starts to accrue some getting, and then giving becomes not an austerity anymore, not a penance, not a sacrifice, but it becomes love. It means that that we don't, although it might be perceived by others to be a sacrifice, we don't perceive it as such. This is the general idea behind austerity, it's value. It's synonymous, as I said, with knowledge. Now, that doesn't mean to say that it can't be abused. In one sense austerity in and of itself is hardly the preoccupation of gaudiya vaishnavism. Gaudiya vaishnavism is not very world denying, it's world embracing actually, but it does teach that in order to embrace the world one has to know what it is. In order to know what something is, sometimes you have to step back from it. Because if you're to close to it you can't see what it is. If you have a bias towards something then you can't see it objectively. You have to step back and get an objective view. Then you can see it for what it is and  
then you can know how to embrace it. Austerity and renunciation, they got together, is about in gaudiya vaishnavism taking a step back from the world to see it for what it really is. What is it? We see it all in relation to Krsna. When we see that, we can enter into it and not be bewildered by it. Then we can interact with sense objects in such a way that it will not be a source of misery. Because we identify the sense objects as the energy of Krsna, to be exploited for the service of Krsna, for the enjoyment of God and so forth. In this way a vaishnava is sometimes difficult to understand. vaisnavera kriya mudra vijneha na bujhaya (Cc Madhya 23.39) He or she may interact with the world and not at all appear to be a person of austerity or renunciation, but that's of course not supposed to be imitated. In the preliminary stages there is some place for austerity but it has to be done in balance in other words, if we... As I said, everybody needs some interaction with sense objects, so we have to find some healthy balance. That will be different for different people. It's difficult to give just very general, everybody must perform certain austerities. What will be a balanced position for one will not be for another, so this is something, every person has to be a thinking person and find proper balance. One can get some good guidance in that regard, find balance and then from there engage in the positive culture of gaudia vaishnavism, hearing and chanting about Krsna and so forth. If one is having a problem with austerity then it's likely that he or she is not in a very balanced position and may be intimidated by or influenced by a particular emphasis of gaudiya vaishnavism that isn't perhaps accurate or helpful. I saw myself that Prabhupada would often, to use him as an example, say things about Krsna consciousness and devotees would latch on to certain things more than others. Generally this happens, we tend to identify with the things that works well with our psychology. Then if you're an influential charismatic person you may preach gaudiya vaishnavism with that kind of emphasis and people end up thinking that this is what gaudiya vaishnavism is about. Like if Prabhupada would say, "well, in the ancient vedic culture women weren't educated, they stayed at home and they cooked", somebody picks up on that and says "women should stay at home, they shouldn't be educated, they should only cook, this is Krsna consciousness". The same thing with austerity, some may identify with austerity. Austerity is should be somewhat natural, healthy, based on understanding, not just blindly. One may go to India, as you say, and get sick and somebody says, well, that was just for your purification. There are other ways to explain that, you drank water that had amoebas in it and that's why you got sick. Sometimes we want to explain things from a kind of an artificial vantage point, like a great soul who sees everything moving according to Krsna's will. That won't always be so useful. If Prabhupada says to someone, do this, and the fellow comes back and says, well Prabhupada, I went to deliver the money to the bank but it fell out of my bag and by the time I got to the bank there was no money there, it must have been Krsna's arrangement. Prabhupada would have said that was Maya's arrangement, not Krsna's arrangement. Krsna sanctions things, nothing moves without the will of Krsna. That doesn't necessarily means that he wants everything that happens to happen. We have some will in the matter too and he doens't interfere with that. So to say that, well, that was for purification, that may be an interesting way to think about that, but whether that was actually a fact and whether you actually got purified from getting sick, having dysentery in India, I don't know. If you think about it in a particular way it may have a purifying effect. If you think, I went to a holy place and I got sick there, I guess I was, I don't know you would think about that.

-I may have been offensive to devotees.

Swami: -Yes, you may think like that. I must have been offensive to devotees in my last life so now this is happening to me. But those are all conjectures and as helpful as they may be in some cases, they can be unhealthy and unhelpful also. I think anyway in general you have to find some balance. Austerity has value. Cold showers, I mean, Krsna consciousness doesn't rest on taking cold showers. One of my godbrothers once told Prabhupada, Prabhupada, I took a warm shower, he said, yes, how else would you get clean. One time a godbrother of mine, he was a sannyasi, in charge of the Cleveland temple, he bought a building in Cleveland. He came in, sawed off all the hot water knobs, so that you couldn't turn the hot water on. Austerity. There has perhaps been some artificiality and we have been warned against artificial austerities very much. Mahaprabhu very much cautioned against this. With balance, it's an important thing. As I mentioned, the principle behind it should be understood. And as I said, ultimately it comes to the whole idea of sacrifice and giving. Physical austerity is in one sense the least important of all of this. If by living in a materially comfortable, for you, situation you can serve Krsna more peacefully and perhaps use those resources effectively rather than being used by them that will be much better than just live in an impoverished type of condition in the name of Krsna consciousness.

-That's kind of what Bhaktivnod Thakur was saying, if any environmental things, like winter or summer, prevent my Krsna consciousness then I reject them.

Swami: -I haven't heard that quote.

-I can't remember exactly, but it's something from his songs.

Swami: -Austerity for what then? Fasting for what? We don't just fast, but on certain days we fast. If you look at why we fast and so forth, what's involved there is devotion to Krsna, because Ekadasi is the day of Krsna. On Ekadasi we may make some effort to be more involved in Krsna's service and less involved with mere bodily upkeep and such concerns. Prabhupada said Ekadasi means feasting, not fasting. You know the whole concept behind this, in the (prakrta or aprakrta? 28:30), in the lila of Krsna the devotees will think, oh, today the moon is showing this particular phase, the eleventh day of the waning or waxing moon, and at that time it effects the tide in such a way that the fluid in the body is increased, this is the theory. When the fluid of the body increase it puts more pressure on the senses. When it puts more pressure on the senses, the senses are more inclined to be in touch with the sense objects. Therefore the neophyte is advised to fast on Ekadasi. But in the lila of Krsna they think, oh, today  the fluids in Krsna's body is increasing and his capacity to enjoy the senses is increased and therefore we should make a feast and serve, pamper him in so many ways more. It depends from which angle one is looking at it. Therefore Prabupada said, oh Ekadasi, it means feasting, not fasting. Our focus should be primarily positive and in the context of positive orientation towards serving Krsna. If some austerity is required then we happily embrace it. It should come to the point where, as I said, it's not an austerity at all. Yes?

(Someone asks a question of how to reconcile the statement about for example not seeing dysentery as some "arrangement for purification" with the verse from Bhagavatam, tat te 'nukampam su-samiksamano (10.14.8)

Swami: -Yes, that is tolerance. What is the fruit of tolerance the Bhagavad-gita say? Krsna says, matra-sparsas tu kaunteya sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah agamapayino 'nityas tams titiksasva bharata. What is the next verse?

-Yam hi na vyathayanty ete purusam purusarsabha sama-duhkha-sukham dhiram so 'mrtatvaya kalpate (BG 2.15).

Swami: -So 'mrtatvaya kalpate, this is the fruit. By tolerating heat, cold, happiness, distress, good, bad, all these things. Krsna says you should know these things are products of sense perception in relation to the mind. What is good, what is bad, what is hot, what is cold, it's all relative. The result of tolerating that, so amrtvaya kalpate. One lives eternally, one tastes the nectar of immortality. That's quoting Bhagavad-gita. You're quoting Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam is speaking to us from a slightly different perspective. Gita says we should tolerate, Bhagavatam says we should see it all as favorable. It's a slight difference to tolerate something and to embrace the same thing. One is an extension of the other. I tolerate, this is an inconvenience, I tolerate that because I think if I tolerate this for the sake of Krsna's service that will be good for me. Or I tolerate, Ok, this is my due, I've sown seeds in the past, now the fruits are coming. If you eat you have to pass stool, you can't complain about that when it happens. It will happen, you will have to deal with that. From tolerating, if one gets the fruit of tolerating, he or she when she starts to taste the fruit they realize, like Srila Sridhar Maharaj said, like that sloka you quoted, that the environment is friendly. This inconveniences, these difficulties that are coming, they are good for me, they are helping me, my past is being retired once and for all. Because I'm embracing it instead of react to it and counteract it. It's me, it's my own, it's what I do, rather than trying to adjust and avoid it, take it as the environment seeking some retribution, Ok, let it have it. In this way by embracing difficulty and calamity and so forth one sees the environment as friendly. One sees, oh, this person has come to give me a hard time, this is my past coming to me, let me take it on. One has to be in a strong position of strong spiritual standing to be able to do that. Like Vasudeva the leper. Worms were feeding on his body and if they would fall of he would pick them back up again, the poor things. This was the consciousness in which he was living. He asked Mahaprabhu, let me take the suffering of everyone on myself that they can go back to Godhead and I will remain here. He had strong standing in devotion. Therefore it it said, such a person is the heir to the kingdom of God, he is already there. We can't be artificial about that. Mentally we try to identify with that ideal and so on, and that will be helpful to us. It's not, as I say, the sickness that purifies you, but the way you think about it.

-You said once that the way we respond to our karma determines our future prospect.

Swami: -Yes, the past and the future are now. That's why we say everything is in the present. We have a past, we are experiencing it in the form of our manifest karma. Karma is often thought to be a doctrine of predestination, but no, it's not really like that. Because how we respond in the present to the past, that will determine our future.

There is a place for finding balance. Don't be, whatever it is, find a balance and what works for you, what enables you to be enthusiastic about spiritual practice.

-Since I've been in contact with Krsna consciousness over the past six years, I found essentially two things that inhibited my ability to try draw nearer to Krsna, and a lot comes from my former orientation of christianity. As a christian I rejected christianity and basically the old testament and the teachings about Yahweh. Yahweh is killing and when he is offended he would, he killed his devotees for not offering the proper sacrifice and whatnot. I guess what my question is, what's the difference between Krsna for example when he kills a demon or how he deals with a devotee when there is an offense?

Swami: -I see. Because of what you read about Yahweh you kind of got turned off to...

-Yes, a little fearful actually, it immediately brought that old christian perception of God back into my mind and made me withdraw inwardly.

Swami: -The difference though is quite significant. The difference is that Krsna never kills any demons. There is a statement by a very learned devotee. In Krsna lila he is the most learned devotee. Who's the most learned devotee in Krsna? Uddhava, that's right. Uddhava is the friend of Krsna in Dvaraka, his counselor, so he has to be learned, to be Krsna's personal advisor. In Dvakara Krsna is a prince and so he has a brahminical advisor, priest. Brahmins would advise the politicians. Brahmin means learned educated sector. He said, aho baki yam stana-kala-kutam
jighamsayapayayad apy asadhvi lebhe gatim dhatry-ucitam tato 'nyam kam va dayalum saranam vrajema (SB 3.2.23). There was a sister of a fellow named Bakasura and she was named Putana. She approached Krsna in Vrindavan, in the pastoral setting where he's not a prince but just a village fellow, a cowherd person. A prince is quite different than a cowherder. There is a huge difference between them. There he was in his infancy and Putana approached him with a very insidious thing in mind. She wanted to kill him. That's bad enough, but how she wanted to kill him was even more significant. She disguised herself as a nurse. In the community it was customary that mothers would share the responsibility of raising children, so there was a plurality of mothers that every child grew up with. There was the principle mother from whom we got birth, like diksa guru, and then there were so many siksa gurus, nursing, helping. She came disguised as one of those mothers, like a siksa guru, and the nourishment that the siksa guru would give as advise, she was going to give in the instance of the lila, the pastime, her nourishment through the milk of her breast. She put poison on the nipple of her breast. You see, when you take these things and you put them together... Think about it, mother smears poison on breast. Mother has gone out, nursemaid smears poison on breast, feeds infant. This would be on CNN. What a story, how could she do it? Very insidious. Infant on the one side, mother on the other side and then she adopts such methods for trying to kill her, it's horrible. Uddhava said this is extraordinary. Aho baki yam stana-kala-kutam. That sister of Bakasura, named Putana, she smeared poisin on her breast to try to kill Krsna. What did Krsna do? Krsna turned her into one of his eternal mothers. That's what he did. He turned her into an eternal mother. In other words, he gave her what we call vatsalya-bhakti. In his eternal drama, she got a position there. He completely overlooked anything that was impure in her motivation and just the fact that she was dressed as a devotee was enough for him. She was dressed as a mother. You see, Krsna is extremely generous. And if that's not enough, he appears as Caitanya Mahaprabhu, where is generosity is fully expressed, it's emphasized. Caitanya Mahaprabhu accepted no offenses, and if because of the order that he accepted as sannyas, in order to do justice to that socially, if someone offended, then he would have to say something. But they were reconciled for example through the person of Nityananda Prabhu, the other self of Gaura Krsna, Nityananda Prabhu, through him. It's said that the two, the combination, they accept no offense, they don't kill anyone. Krsna doesn't kill anyone either, in Vraja, but Visnu does. Visnu is inside of Krsna. Krsna is svayam bhagavan. All manifestations of Godhead are within Krsna. He's the source. The Visnu inside of Krsna killed Putana. But Krsna just closed his eyes and while she was killed by Visnu, Krsna gave her eternal motherhood. Uddhava, such a learned fellow, said, who in their right mind would take shelter of Yahweh, Visnu or any other manifestation of divinity than Krsna? Only a crazy person. He is so merciful, so generous. When we hear the lilas of Krsna killing demons, it's not Krsna, it's the Visnu inside of him. If you look deeply into the philosophy you see, oh, Krsna is looking the other way actually. In that for that matter ? (45:12), so it's worth saying, worth mentioning that those that he might... God kills everybody anyway. The hand of time is a manifestation of God, everyone has to die. So to blame God for killing someone is a litle bit of a stretch. Who is he killing anyway? Who is killing who? Who is there to blame? You see, there is only God, God and his energy. One of the big problems of life is that we make compalints against God as if we have some independent position. Actually we don't. We are also Krsna. We are a particle of one of the saktis of Krsna. Can you blame someone for doing what they want with themselves? Not really. Who's to blame? There is no one else. The problem is that we think there is someone else, we think we have an independent existence. We don't. From the broadest perspective it's all play. What is this life? If God is to take it away, what is it anyway? When God takes it away by the hands of time or personally in something like a lila, what's really happening? We are to be instructed by that as to the temporal nature of the whole affair. You see? ayur harati vai pumsam udyann astam ca yann asau, with the rising and setting of the sun our life is being taken away everyday. That's the hand of time. Everyday we are dying. We are being killed with the rising and setting of the sun. We don't think about it. Therefore we pursue things that have no endurance, although we want enduring happiness. That's not very wise. Even in the lila, if Krsna kills somebody they will be liberated. But Krsna particularly is the manifestation, the full face of God, the heart of divinity. If you're a christian then christians like to think that Christ's appearance is the greatest story ever told, the greatest story on earth, because it's an act in which God sacrificed is son for humanity or something like that. In christ we find a high degree of self sacrifice and that is certainly noble. But self-sacrifice and self-forgetfulnes, they are not different but one. The latter is an extension, a development of the former. If we consciously make a sacrifice for others that's one thing, it means that we are conscious of our self. But when we are unconscious of our self in love and we just do things, that's a development from self-sacrifice. We want to move from selfishness to self-sacrifice to self-forgetfulness. Vraja lila, Krsna lila, Gaura lila, this is God showing self-forgetfulness, the value of self-forgetfulness. We appreciate the christian idea of self-sacrifice. A fellow told me once, I tried to sell him the Srimad Bhagavatam, he said, I don't really need that. I said, why not? And he said, because in my religion we know the social life of God. I liked his answer, I thought that was very nice, pretty profound. He said, whatever is in your book, I know something more, because we know God on such intimate terms that we know his social life. I said, that's great, what is his social life? He said, well, God got a son, sent his son to earth and he told the whole story. I said well, I tell you what, I think you got to take this book anyway, because here he talks about his other sons and his wives and unwedded friends. This is the full story of the social life of God. In fact, this is the private social life of God. You know something about the public social life, he sent his son, good news. What is the good news? Law is superceded by love, this is the good news. This is the general doctrine of christianity. Law is superceded by love. We agree with that. But talking about it is one thing and promoting self-sacrfice all valuable. But Krsna lila is the full expression of that reality, love above law. if you study it, you come to that conclusion. Does that brig you closer to Krsna?

-Yes.

Swami: -Krsna is not about justice. Justice is the lower realm. Krsna is about mercy. Mercy supercedes justice. There needs to be justice in order for there to be mercy. Because if there is no justice to override, then there cannot be mercy. There are manifestations of God who are more preoccupied with justice. There is a place for that. But Krsna, that's another thing. That's love, mercy. Therefore, we who are approaching Krsna, we really do have nothing to complain about. We are waiting in line to enter and the ticket is... It's a line of mercy. We can't complain there. As soon as we complain there and ask for justice we are out of there, thrown out. If justice is brought to bear, we don't even belong there. It's wonderful that the highest expression of divinity, which is so, in one sense, inapproachable, because it is what it is, it is therefore approachable. As the highest manifestation of divinity is such, it's the full expression of love and self-giving. As I said last night, guru is giving, disciple must give. God is giving in the form of Krsna and Gaura Krsna, Caitanya Mahaprabhu especially. It's all about giving. If you take two things and put them together, the highest thing, and you give it to who? You give the highest thing to the most qualified people, right? But not Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He gave the highest thing to the most unqualified people. There you have the full expression of magnanimity. Do you understand? 

-In your commentary to BG 4.34 you write "The practitioner's own heart free from the clutter of material desire appears before him in the form of sri guru".

Swami: -Yes, it's mentioned like that in the Caitanya-caritamrta. Our possibility, our prospect in life come before us in a practical manifestation. That's so valuable to us, not theoretically but practically. The devotee takes the theory and brings it into the realm of the practical. Therefore, devotees' association is so valuable to us, much more than book reading. Much more valuable to us is associating with advanced devotees. The book we may misunderstand. It can not ask us, so did you understand?, when we finish the page. But a saintly person, a vaisnava can say, did you understand, what did you understand? Tell me. And when you have not understood and it's apparent he says no, it's like this. Sometimes he's described as an active agent of divinity rather than a passive agent of divinity which scripture would be. The association of devotees, as I said, brings the theoretical into the realm of the practical. In their company we can learn how to practice it. And practice will always be different than theory. You have to understand this. Theory is one thing, it won't be different, but it's application is dynamic. Some just say, read the book, that's enough. It's not enough, it's not at all enough. The book doesn't say that it's enough. The book doesn't say that. So those who say, just read the book, you don't need a guru for example, the book doesn't say that. The one who is saying that is not reading the book. That's the problem. We need guidance. If we don't want guidance there is a problem for us. The most advanced devotees are crying, Narottama Das Thakur is crying, oh, I lost the association of Rupa-Sanatan, Krsna Das Kaviraj, this one, that one. What is my situation, I'm so pitiful. Mahaprabhu himself through Ray Ramananda taught the most unfortunate thing in the world is to not have the association of advanced, a pure devotee of Krsna. Devotees in general and then the guru is a particular devotee in the context of devotees who we would associate with, because why? Because their faith, which is what moves them, affected us to some extent, we have been affected by that to some extent, so we keep that company. In the context then of keeping the company of those devotees, one devotee stands out to us, by his or her example and precept, so we latch on, we take shelter there. That becomes our guru. Guru is our very own heart, our highest ideal at heart coming before us. It's not a separate thing. One of my disciples said that she had joined me and a friend wrote a letter and said, well, it's interesting that you're in that group and everything, but I just hope that when you look in the mirror you smile, you can still smile. He was thinking, you are there, you sent me all this philosophy in your last letter, but are you really happy there? She wrote back and said, I used to look in the mirror and smile, but when I look in the mirror now I don't smile. Because someone has shown me so many things about myself that I didn't know where there. I've been sweeping dirt under the rug for years and so I don't have nothing to smile about in one sense, when I look at myself. But, she said, when I look at my guru then I smile. I liked that. I said, this is the point. When you look at your guru you see the prospect, what you could be, all that you could be, coming before you in a way, in a practical manifestation by example and teaching. This is our heart's own prospect, our ideal coming before us, manifesting before us, mystical. We should not have a separate idea, I'm here, my guru is there, this is how we're related. Do you understand? It's mentioned like that in the Adi-lila of Caitanya-caritamrta.

-We had a discussion this morning about a point that you made about Krsna may sanction something but it may not be his will. I guess I have a hard time with that, because I guess I feel that ultimately everything is happening for a higher purpose and that he is involved in his creation.

Swami: -Well, it's a difficult, obviously, question, the principle of free will is huge issue. From the broadest perspective we can say there is no free will. That's what you're saying basically, whether you realize it or not. But we can't really function like that at this stage. If you just do that, then you blame Krsna for everything, right? It's Krsna's will, it just happened, Krsna must have wanted it. Krsna must have wanted it, and such and such an atrocity happened. This is not a very satisfactory way of answering everything. So therefore we say that the jiva soul is a facsimile of Krsna, so it has some will also and some allowance to exercise will, and if it exercises it will in a particular way Krsna will reciprocate accordingly.

-I guess what I have a problem is that, you know, one jiva may have the will to do something hurtful or harmful to other jivas, so Krsna is sanctioning that or allowing that to happen. And I guess, I can not, unless there is a...

Swami: -Obviously there is a broader picture and this is one frame in the movie of everyone's existence. There is a past and it's not always apparent exactly what it was. These are huge, of course, philosophical or theological issues that every, and we have talked about this before, every tradition has to deal with, what is evil and how is God absolved from evil. The gaudiyas absolve God from evil by way of positing anadi karma. This is vedanta sutra. What does anadi mean? Without beginning. Beginningless karma. But ultimately, sometimes you cannot ask about the why of things, you can only ask the how. You cannot ask why God exists. The fact is that God does exist. Why does evil exist? The fact is that evil does exist. How it exists should suffice. How does it exist? What is the dynamics? How is it working? After all, there is no why to everything ultimately. Reality is just expressing itself and the background of that is joy, the background of that is its fulness. Because it's fulness, it's complete. It celebrates its fulness. In the course of celebrating its fulness, when that's viewed from different angles of vision it appears to be one thing or another, classified like this or categorized like that, but ultimately that's from our limited vantage point that we come to those conclusions. 

-Then is it naive to think that ultimately everything that happens is to have the jivas return to their original position?

Swami: -All jivas are first of all unlimited. There is no limit to the number of jivas, so there is no point in time that all jivas will be liberated.

-So it's an ongoing lila? I guess I'm thinking that what is happening now is to liberate the jivas that are here now. I mean, it will just continue, it's a fact, more jivas will come, but ultimately Krsna wants us all to be liberated.

Swami: -That's why Visnu manifest the jivas and then he enters into the world that they might meet their maker. Krsna manifests as a form of avatar for the sake of the sadhakas. Of course, in the course of doing that other sadhakas are created also.

Vrindaranya: -That brings up an interesting point, because there are no jivas that are created at a certain point in time. So it means that there are some jivas that never get, that are eternally in illusion. 

Swami: -Does it?

Vrindaranya: -Well, it has to if there's no point that everyone will come to liberty and they are all existing now, there are no new jivas created.

Swami: -I don't know. Yes?

-I'm trying to practice talking to Krsna and I feel that he responds through people and things, but not from within my heart. Could you say something about that? (The one who's asking had taken advice from some type of astrologer.)

-I think that the form in which Krsna most predominantly manifests locally to deal with us, I mean God is everywhere, but to deal with us locally amd in a tailor made way for our tradition and so forth is the manifestation of the guru. We say caitya guru, the inner guru, and mahant guru. In this sense Krsna is coming before us. Krsna is in our heart and come before us in the form of the guru to talk to us. The deity is there. The deity doesn't talk to you for the most part, because you're not ready. Beause if he started talking to you then you would be too busy, and you're already to busy with other things. When you give up those other things, then Krsna will start talking to you, because your interested enough in him to spend the kind of time he requires. Do you understand? The deity is very merciful, he doesn't talk. The guru brings a form of Krsna, in Prabhupada's language, that we can handle. If we handle him nicely we become attracted to him. We start giving up other things, then he starts to express hismelf that much more and then he will talk. That's one part. Another part is that God in the heart, the general idea is Paramatma. We are not interested in Paramatma. We are more interested in the guru who is saksat Vrajendranandana, who is a manifestatiion of Vrajendranandana Krnsa, not Paramatma. Of course, if we love Krsna, then Krsna will be in our heart, not the Paramatma. yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami (BS 5.38). Like you see a picture of Hanuman. Have you seen the picture? He is tearing apart is heart because someone told him that Sita Rama was inside his heart. I would listen carefully to mahajano yena gatah sa panthah (Cc Madhya 17.186). There was a fellow, astrology type, we called him a tantric, in Mayapur, in the area of West Bengal. After Prabhupada left, a number of devotees was going to him and he was giving predictions about Iskcon, about this, about that and so forth. This was a famous tantric. Sitting with Srila Sridhar Maharaj, some devotees asked him what he thought about what the tantric had said, his opinion. Sridhar Maharaj said dharmasya tattvam nihitam guhayam mahajano yena gatah sa panthah (Cc Madhya 17.186). That put the end to the tantric altogether. It means we should follow in the footsteps of great souls, because in their heart, guhyam, the secret of dharma is found there. Therefore, guhyam akyati prcchati. This is a symptom of love. We should try to interact with an advanced devotee in such a way that he or she will be inclined to reveal their heart to us. What a valuable thing that is, what's in the heart of an advanced devotee. That's such a valuable thing for us to hear about. We should listen to such devotees, not astrologers, about how to practice Krsna consciousness. Do you pay him?

-Yes.

Swami: -He may give some advice. But even then, his realm... You can pay him for astrological advice, but not for spiritual advice. They are two different things. If he's giving spiritual advice, you should tell him that he is going beyond his parameters, I paid for an astrologer, not for a guru. Gurus are free anyway, why are you charging? And how do you know he does not tell that to every client, "Krsna is in your heart, and I can show you how to...", that will be an extra session. I don't mean to berate him, he may have good intentions and so forth, but I wouldn't take it to seriously. Who would tell us about Krsna and how to communicate with Krsna, that's not the business of an astrologer. The fault, you see, of astrology is slight in one sense, but very big in another sense. There is one planet that the astrologers don't take into consideration in the chart. That is called Goloka. Golokera prema dhana harinama sankirtan (har hari biphale). The sankirtan of the holy name of Krsna, that comes from there, from Goloka to here. That is the most important planet. Do you understand? That's when you want to go to Krsnaloka. That's not in your chart. How is Krsnaloka in your chart? Golokera prema dhana harinama sankirtan. It comes through sankirtan of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Goloka comes into your chart. Then everything changes. What did Prabhupada say about palmistry? We just clap our hands three times like this and then the lines change. Your destiny will be different when Krsnaloka is in your chart. And it's in the heart through Caitanya Mahaprabhu's sankirtan, so you take advantage of this teaching, hearing and chanting. It doesn't say anything in Caitanya-caritamrta, BRS, SB, as one of the angas of bhakti, "see an astrologer". Otherwise, if you want to think in a general way as you have, Krsna is your friend, that is good, that is an anga of bhakti. What else?

-Sometimes you're in a situation and trying to think how to get out of it. Then devotees preach that it's your karma and that if you try to get out of it you will just end up with the same problem elsewhere. So what's the point? I'm not sure if it's valid or invalid, because you could say. The inventor of the lightbulb ??? made a thousand of those before he succeeded. I'm sure someone told him that he was stupid and wasting his time. What's the difference between those two things? Because I think even Prabhupada said something to the effect of if you're persevering even in the face of failure you can still accomplish whatever you're trying to accomplish.

Swami: -Everything has to be taken with some balance. We are also told to find favorable circumstances for practicing spiritual life. We don't tell people who live in a situation that we would deem unconducive to spiritual practice, just stay there and practice, do we? We say, get out of there, find a conducive place to practice Krsna consciousness. The real determining factor is this, if I'm telling you, just stay where you are and practice Krsna consciousness, but you just can't practice Krsna consciousness there, then my advice is not very good, is it? If your circumstances are such that they are impeding your capacity to actually practice, you have to change the circumstances. That should be the guiding principle. Get yourself in a situation that is conducive for your spiritual practice and culture. Otherwise these type of advices is counterproductive and it may be ? ---motivated (1:17:16). People get in situations for example where a temple is opened, there is an economy to it. Economy means people are required and so for the sake of the economy a particular type of advise is being given to you, but if the one advising you is influenced by that and not purely in your interest... Therefore it's important to get advise from people who only have your interest in mind, who have nothing to gain. That's the kind of person who can give the best advise to us. It's obviously counterproductive of someone is trying to browbeat you and say you should stay in this circumstance and tolerate because that's what Krsna consciousness is about, persevere. But your going down, what's the meaning of that? Because as I said, the other side is there also, create a favorable environment for practicing Krsna consciousness. All the goswamis did that. Their asramas were beautiful places in Vrindavan. If you go to Sanatan Goswami's asrama and look at the Yamuna, what is was like 500 years ago. He found a beautiful place to do his bhajan in Vrindavan. Some of the places where they did their bhajan are very unconducive now, externally, to spiritual practice. One should have a dynamic way of thinking about all these things. There is a bottom line in everything and that is your Krsna consciousness, how it's developing and everything should be adjusted accordingly.
